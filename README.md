## Overview

This repository contains a series of projects completed during my Database Systems course at The University of Tulsa. The projects cover a range of database-related tasks, including:

- Designing and setting up a relational database using MySQL Workbench  
- Writing and optimizing extensive SQL queries  
- Integrating SQL functionality into a Java application  

These projects demonstrate both foundational and applied skills in database management and Java-based backend development.
